# Coffee Project
This is a copy of the code and documentation my team wrote for our Coffee Shop project for SWE 3113-Intro to Software Engineering. 

My contributions lie primarily within the project's scope, Use Case, Entity Relationship, and Class Design diagrams, as well as the Payment and Reciept forms.
